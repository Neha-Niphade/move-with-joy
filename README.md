# Move With Joy ðŸššâœ¨

This is a simple landing page I built for **Move With Joy**, a moving services startup.  
The idea is to keep the design clean and welcoming, with a short intro about the company, call-to-action buttons, and an image that matches the theme.

## Features
- Hero section with a title, description, and two buttons ("Get a Quote" and "Contact Us")
- Clean and minimal layout
- Responsive design (works on desktop and mobile)

## Tech Stack
- HTML  
- CSS  

## How to View
You can open the `index.html` file directly in your browser, or check out the live site once I deploy it using GitHub Pages.

## Why I Made This
I wanted to practice creating a professional-looking landing page and also get comfortable with hosting projects on GitHub Pages.
